   Conversation with team lead and CTO about getting a feature ready for beta launch - They had a lot to discuss and I had some thoughts - When they wrapped up and I started sharing my asks, both of them kept interrupting me every few seconds for the first thirty seconds - I got frustrated and asked if they could please stop interrupting me, hold their questions until the end, I wanted to finish my thought - I followed with both of them to say I was sorry for my frustrated tone. It was interrupting my flow and I got frustrated. I should have kept a calm tone. - There are lots of reasons why people interrupt and the team and I have tried to be better about interrupting and stopping ourselves when we do

- Tell me about a time you needed to get information from someone who wasn’t very responsive. What did you do?

   Had a deadline to post a blog about a feature - Colleague didn't provide info after a few asks and pings on Slack - Followed up with them in person, gave context on the criticality, and set up a meeting - Going forward we always set up meetings for things with deadlines to make sure we had a block of time to discuss
